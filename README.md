## Introduction

Alchemy is an open-source file converter (built on Electron and React). It also supports operations like merging files together into a pdf. We hope to support more operations and file types soon!

## Features

* **Beautifully simple**. Super easy, drag-and-drop interface for converting/merging files
* **Merge files**. Merge multiple images into one pdf, you can even change the file order
